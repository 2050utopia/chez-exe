ChezScheme Self-Hosting Executable

The goal of this project is to produce executables that are a complete
ChezScheme system and contain a scheme program.
This is to work by embedding the ChezScheme boot files and a scheme program
into ELF sections of a binary

BUILDING

You must download and build ChezScheme (https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme)
before you can build this project. Once you have done that, you can build
chez-exe by invoking make like so:

  make csdir=/path/to/ChezScheme m=$machinetype

machinetype must match the machine-type specifier ChezScheme provides.
